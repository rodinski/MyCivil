#MyCivil

When setting up a new folder to hold this stuff 
getting   My::   paths correct is a big deal 
follow this recipe so that the MyCivil directory does 
not get created. 

cd My
(now in direcory My this should be the child of a 
directory in the perl @INC )

git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/rodinski/MyCivil.git
git pull origin master


Happy perling!
